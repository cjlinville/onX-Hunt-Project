# onX Hunt Takehome Project
## General Overview
Description - Create an interactive, web-based map to support planning and in-field use when 
hunting in a new unit for the first time. 

Evaluation Criteria: 
-  Effective use of automation for data collection and standardization 
-  Proficiency in working with geospatial data sources 
-  Accuracy, clarity, and usability of the map 
-  Demonstrated understanding of hunting and relevant contextual information 
-  Quality and clarity of documentation and the summary

# Approach

For this project I will put together a web app that supports planning and in field use for hunting Rocky Mountain Big Horn Sheep in Sheep Hunting District 102 in North-Western Montana. Focus will be placed on maintaining scalability.


## Data collection

Data and sources that will support effective planning in this area include:

Regulatory boundaries:
- Federal and state land boundaries
- Hunting District Boundary

Planning related Data:
- Access (roads - trails)
- Water
- Terrain derivatives
- Known species range

## Processing and Standardization

Use python scripts to homogenize collected data

## Map Creation

Most data layers are built in map box, delve into UI for this part
